This Android app uses a native OpenGL ES 2/3 compatable render system along with
the Bullet Physics SDK to provide an XML-defined graphical 3D simulation that can
also be built as a native desktop application using GLFW3 for window
management. The Android portion of application is derived from the gles3jni
Android SDK sample ( see https://github.com/googlesamples/android-ndk/tree/master/gles3jni ).

Building the Desktop Application:
All third-party dependencies are either included in the repository or installed
via the ExternalProject_Add function provided by the CMake build system and Git. It can be
built for Windows with MSVC, MinGW or Linux. The build script will attempt to download and 
build all dependencies then link them statically. An advantage of this approach is the 
ability to easily install the debug symbols across different platforms.
The following dependencies will be fetched via Git:

https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git
https://github.com/g-truc/glm.git
https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader.git
https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3.git

Exising versions of these dependencies can be specified by enabling the following CMake parameters:
-DUSE_EXISTING_GLFW3:BOOL=ON
-DUSE_EXISTING_GLM:BOOL=ON
-DUSE_EXISTING_BULLET:BOOL=ON
-DUSE_EXISTING_TINYOBJLOADER:BOOL=ON

Running the Desktop Application:
There are various assets found in app/src/main/assets that need to be in the current directory in
order for the application to work correctly.

Building the Android Application:
This application requires the Android NDK and relies on a slightly different CMake build script
than the desktop application and will be used to produce shared libraries for multiple architectures.
The CMake build is triggered by the top-level Gradle build script.

License Information:
There are included files which use the Android Open Source License: gl3stub_wrapper.c, gl3stub.c.inc 
and gl3stub.h which are part of the gles3jni Android sample and used for compatibility.
There are a number of included dependencies that use various permissive open source licences such as
stb_image.h, rapidxml.hpp, and OpenGL extension loading provided by the GLAD code generator.
